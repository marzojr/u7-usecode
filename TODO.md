## Egg Data Analysis

- [ ] Dump egg data from Serpent Isle Beta (SIB) and compare with final Serpent Isle (SI/SS) to identify cut content
  - Look for differences in egg placement, function assignments, and disabled eggs (function 0x000)
  - Document any plot elements that were removed between beta and release
  - This may help explain why certain eggs have zeroed function fields instead of being deleted
