# Agent Reference

For general project information, background, and detailed tool descriptions, see [README.md](README.md).

## Scope of Permitted Changes

**⚠️ This repository is primarily a documentation and conversion project.** Agent-initiated changes must be limited to:

* Improving naming (variables, functions, labels) for clarity.
* Improving comments and documentation.
* Formatting and style fixes (whitespace, indentation, punctuation).

**Do not** make any changes that alter the logic or behaviour of the Usecode: do not add, remove, or reorder instructions; do not change operand values, control flow, or function signatures. The goal is faithful reproduction of the original game code, and any logic change would compromise that.
